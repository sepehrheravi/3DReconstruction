# 3D Reconstruction from Multiple Images

 Created a visualization of a 3D reconstruction by finding correspondences between multiple images that are taken using a camera from
 different angles by having their extrinsic and intrinsic camera matrices. The project was done using NumPy, OpenCV, and Open3D
 libraries in Python and visualized using Pypotree.
